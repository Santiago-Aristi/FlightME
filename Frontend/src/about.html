        <h2>David Bresich</h2>
        <p>A pretty regular guy, writes some code. He made most of this webpage and got frustrated with aligning images and just kind of gave up.
            <br>I don't really know what to write in here, I'm just hoping that I can get the JavaScript done for this project. This whole thing <br>
            scares me and I don't really know if I can do it correctly. But, here's to nothing and good times! Huzzah!
